# WordPress image optim #

This is a proof of concept to optimize yourself the images on your site without using a service.
You only have to got on the plugin folder and put this on the console :

```
npm install
```

And then everything will be fine :)
You can change the values for png and jpg qualities on imageoptim.js file.

Have fun ;)

TODO :
 * Add security
 * Add Javascript on it
 * Redirect on image single with the message of optimized element
 * Add WP-CLI support
 * Add bulk optimize
